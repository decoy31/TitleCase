# Title Capitalization
Many writers are often confused by the different methods of capitalizing titles. There are several forms of capitalization rules, but one of the most popular is called "title case" or "up style." Implement a function that will take a title in the form of a string and return the string with the correct capitalization for a title according to these rules.

- Always capitalize the first word in a title.
- Always capitalize the last word in a title.
- Lowercase the following words, unless they are the first or last word of the title: "a", "the", "to", "at", "in", "with", "and", "but", "or".
- Uppercase any words not in the list above. (This is not the exact set of rules, but pretty close.) A word is defined as a series of non-space characters.
  - Example 1: "i love solving problems and it is fun"
    - Would return "I Love Solving Problems and It Is Fun"
  - Example 2: "wHy DoeS A biRd Fly?"
    - Would return "Why Does a Bird Fly?"
